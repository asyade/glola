# What is not GLOLA
A graphical library that can be used by anyone, `GLOLA` is purely experimental and not likely to be adapted to your hardware or your software configuration, if you do not know what you're doing here : run away

# Use case
Imagine that you got very huge led matrix *ex: 400*400* that is controlled using `DMX` packet. If you want to use the led matrix as a screen with a reasonable refresh rate you must splite your led matrix into multiple `artnet` univers, the result is that you muste split your pixels buffer propely and you know the hardware limitations to avoid visual glitch. This library is made to reduce this complexity and provide a *safe* and *easy to use* wrapper for a complexe `OLA` configuration.

# Wrapper
`GLOLA` is made from native code and his API is quite simple so you can use it in most programming languages but some wrapper are already made for NodeJS, C/C++ and RUST

# Usage
* wip
