# What is not GLOLA
A graphical library that can be used by anyone, GLOLA is purely experimental and not likely to be adapted to your hardware or your software configuration, if you do not know what you're doing here : run away

# What is GLOLA
imagine that you got very huge led matrix ex: 400*400 that is controlled using DMX packet. If you want to use the led matrix as a screen with a reasonable refresh rate you must splite your led matrix into multiple artnet univers, the result is that you muste split your pixels buffer propely and you muste know the hardware limitations to avoid glitch. This library is made to reduce this complexity and provide a safe and easy to use wrapper for a complexe OLA configuration.
