# What is not GLOLA
A graphical library that can be used by anyone, `GLOLA` is purely experimental and not likely to be adapted to your hardware or your software configuration, if you do not know what you're doing here : run away

# What is GLOLA
An easy to use and safe wrapper for complexe OLA configuration.
## but still ?
Imagine that you got very huge led matrix *ex: 400\*400* that is controlled using `DMX` packet, for using it as a screen with a reasonable refresh rate you must splite your led matrix into multiple `artnet` univers and be aware of the hardware limitations to avoid visual glitch. This library reduce the complexity by providing simple API and ensure the refresh rate is respected.

# Wrapper
`GLOLA` is made from native code and his API is quite simple so you can use it in most programming languages but some wrapper are already made for NodeJS, C/C++ and RUST

# Usage
* wip
